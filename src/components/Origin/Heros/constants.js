      he took it back with him to Mars.
      <br /><br />
      Back home, Yasu delved into researching the katana and uncovered the rich history and code of the samurai. Fascinated by their discipline 
      and philosophy, he began to teach himself the ways of the samurai, integrating these ancient teachings into his modern life. 
      The katana became a symbol of his dedication and honor.
      <br /><br />
      Recognizing his potential, Null, the leader of the Code, offered Yasu augmentation with nanoswarm technology. 
      Embracing the transformation, Yasu gained the ability to rematerialize over short distances and materialize weapons from the swarm. 
      These enhancements made him an even more formidable bounty hunter, combining the ancient ways of the samurai with the advanced technology of the Code.
      <br /><br />
      Yasu's journey as a bounty hunter is marked by his unwavering commitment to the Code. He navigates the complexities of his role

As resources dwindled and the military leadership hoarded what little remained, Null saw an opportunity for change. Developing a revolutionary nanotechnology, he not only freed humanity from its dependence on food and water but also from oppressive leadership. With the power to enhance human capabilities at the molecular level, Null led an uprising that ultimately toppled the regime, though it came at the cost of the underground city’s collapse.
<br />
<br />
After the destruction, Null made the ultimate sacrifice, uploading his consciousness into the very nanobots he created. Now a swarm of intelligent nanotechnology, Null leads The Code from their new home on Mars, where the faction thrives under his guidance. His presence can manifest in a semi-physical form when needed, appearing as a skeletal, otherworldly figure—both fearsome and awe-inspiring. Despite his intimidating appearance, Null remains stoic and calculated, driven by logic and precision. His leadership is never swayed by emotion, ensuring that every decision is for the betterment of The Code.
<br />
<br />
The Code's governance operates through a decentralized blockchain-like system, designed by Null himself. Each citizen’s contribution to society is recorded and influences their standing within the meritocratic structure. His mission is clear: to safeguard The Code's technological advancement and ensure their survival, while selectively sharing their nanotechnology with strategically valuable worlds in need of liberation. 
Though his human form is gone, Null's vision remains unshaken—a future defined by technological mastery, where the mistakes of the past are never repeated.

He was known to go days—sometimes weeks—without emerging, his mind constantly occupied with new projects. Those closest to him knew that he was always thinking ahead, focused on pushing the boundaries of what the Rebels could achieve. While he seldom discussed his future plans, his contributions to the faction’s survival were enough to earn him the unwavering trust of his peers.
<br />
<br />
His relentless drive to perfect his technology sometimes raised quiet questions about what else he might be working on behind closed doors. Whatever Estario is working on next, his contributions continue to shape the future of the Rebels, pushing the faction toward greater heights of survival and success.

But as he grew older, he began to yearn for more than just the sterile environment of the labs. He developed a love for music and often sneaked out to experience the vibrant nightlife of the city. The neon lights, the rhythm of the streets, and the freedom of the urban sprawl call to him. He dreams of adventures beyond the confines of the laboratory, of using his abilities for something greater than just being a guinea pig.

While others embraced the safety and structure of life under protective domes, Kat longed for something more. She was restless, driven by an insatiable curiosity about the world beyond the walls. As soon as she was able, she joined the scouting division—the only place where her adventurous spirit could truly thrive.
<br />
<br />
As a scout, Kat is tasked with monitoring Earth’s wild, mutated wilderness and gathering intelligence for the Guard. The role suits her perfectly, allowing her to spend long stretches of time outside the biodomes, exploring and pushing the boundaries of her physical and mental endurance. Her natural instincts and agility made her an ideal candidate for a controversial gene-editing program, designed to give scouts an edge in the dangerous world beyond.
<br />
<br />
Using DNA from big cats, the Guard genetically enhanced Kat to tap into her adrenaline reserves in ways ordinary humans cannot. Her cat-like eyes allow her to see in low light, and her reflexes and speed make her a formidable presence during missions. While all scouts undergo similar procedures, Kat has always stood out. Her enhancements seem to push her abilities further, making her faster, stronger, and sharper than her peers.
<br />
<br />
Despite these modifications, Kat remains a free spirit, following her instincts and often bending the rules when she sees fit. She relishes the freedom of the wilderness, away from the rigid structure of Sanctuary. However, the more time she spends exploring the remnants of Earth’s past, the more questions she finds herself asking—about the world she’s tasked to observe and the Guard she’s loyal to. For now, these thoughts remain in the back of her mind, overshadowed by her love for the unknown and the thrill of discovery.
